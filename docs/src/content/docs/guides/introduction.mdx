`WithESLint` is a tool that makes it easy to manage projects ESLint configurations.


### Features

- One-line configuration reusable across projects.
- Designed to work with `JSX`, `TypeScript` out-of-box.
- Reasonable defaults: best practices, with better code quality.
- Opinionated defaults: single quotes, no semicolons, sorted imports.
- Auto-fix formatting for consistent code style.
- Utilizes ESLint's new flat config format for easy composition.
- Support also for `Astro`, `React`, `Svelte`, `Solid`, `Vue`.

### Why?

- In many cases, there's a need to install a variety of dependencies like plugins, configs, and parsers, while also necessitating manual updates to configuration dependencies. Meanwhile, you may also encounter issues with plugin, config, and parser versions, requiring a significant amount of time to identify problems and find solutions.
- Many configurations consist solely of common rules, necessitating extensive customization to meet the specific requirements of your project. Meanwhile, having to repeatedly set up ESLint configurations for each project is definitely not ideal.
