Welcome to WithESLint!

`WithESLint` is a tool that makes it easy to manage projects ESLint configurations.


### Features

- Auto fix for formatting
- Single quotes, no semicolons
- Sorted imports, dangling commas for cleaner commit diff
- Designed to work with `JSX`, `TypeScript` out-of-box
- Support also for `Astro`, `React`, `Svelte`, `Solid`, `Vue`
- [ESLint Flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new), compose easily!
- Reasonable defaults, best practices, only one-line of config

### Why?

- In many cases, there's a need to install a variety of dependencies like plugins, configs, and parsers, while also necessitating manual updates to configuration dependencies. Meanwhile, you may also encounter issues with plugin, config, and parser versions, requiring a significant amount of time to identify problems and find solutions.
- Many configurations consist solely of common rules, necessitating extensive customization to meet the specific requirements of your project. Meanwhile, having to repeatedly set up ESLint configurations for each project is definitely not ideal.
